    <p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: black;" >Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth. 
    The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai.
    Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.
    His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >Shivaji belonged to Maratha family of Bhonsle clan.His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence.</p>
    <p  style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.</p>

<h2>Early life</h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: black; color: darkblue;" >
    Sambhaji was born into a Marathi Hindu family at Purandar fort to the Maratha ruler Shivaji, and his first wife Saibai, who died when he was two years old and he was raised by his paternal grandmother Jijabai.At the age of nine, Sambhaji was sent to live with Raja Jai Singh I of Amber as a political hostage to ensure compliance of the Treaty of Purandar that Shivaji had signed with the Mughals on 11 June 1665. As a result of the treaty, Sambhaji became a Mughal mansabdar.
    He and his father Shivaji attended the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's court at Agra on 12 May 1666. Aurangzeb put both of them under house arrest but they escaped on 22 July 1666.However, the two sides reconciled and had cordial relations during the period 1666–1670. During the period between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb conferred the title of raja on Shivaji. Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal mansabdar with 5,000 horses. Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji with general Prataprao Gujar to serve the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam. Sambhaji was also granted territory in Berar for revenue collection.In this period, Shivaji and Sambhaji fought alongside the Mughals against the Sultanate of Bijapur.

<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: black; color: darkblue;">
    Sambhaji was married to Jivubai in a marriage of political alliance; per Maratha custom she took the name Yesubai. Jivubai was the daughter of Pilajirao Shirke, who had entered Shivaji's service following the defeat of a powerful deshmukh Rao Rana Suryajirao Surve who was his previous patron. This marriage thus gave Shivaji access to the Konkan coastal belt.Yesubai had two children, daughter Bhavani Bai and then a son named Shahu, who later became the Chhatrapati of the Maratha empire.</p>
